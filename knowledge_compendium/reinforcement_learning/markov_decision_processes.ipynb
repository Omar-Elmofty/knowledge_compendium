    "## What is an MDP?\n",
    "\n",
    "A markhov desicion process is a process that describes an environment in which an agent can act. An MDP is **fully observable** (meaning that the agent knows everything about the state of the environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all RL problems can be converted into some form of MDP (even partially observable ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Markov Property\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the previous lecture, the markov property of the state where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P[S_{t+1}|S_t] = P[S_{t+1}|S_1, ..., S_t]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning that the future is only conditioned on the present not the past. The future only depends on the present and is independent of the past. The present state contains all the relevent information to determine the future. Once the present state is known the entire history can be thrown away (i.e. the current state is a sufficient statistic of the future).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Markov Process\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov process is a random process with some transition dynamics. A Markov process involves state transitions from one state ot the other. $S_1 \\rightarrow S_2 \\rightarrow ... S_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the Markhov process involes defining:\n",
    "1. $S$ is a finite set of states\n",
    "2. $P$ is a state transition probability matrix: $P_{ss'} = P[S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s]$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a markov process. Our state is the location of the agent on the grid (x, y indices)."
