    "- Typically involve diving the input up, operating on it. May involve some work to reconcile the solutions of the divided subproblems.\n",
    "- Usually involves recursion, where the input is halfed, creating a binary recursion tree of depth log_2(n).\n",

    "\n",
    "> The master method is a formal way to analyze recursive divide and conquer algorithms.\n",

    "Looking at the following recurence:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) \\leq aT(\\frac{n}{b}) + n^d\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three different scenarios that the master method presents:\n",
    "1. if $a == b^d$, then the complexity is $O(n^dlog(n))$ - we perform the same amount of work per level ($n^d$) and we have $log(n)$ levels.\n",
    "2. If $a < b^d$, then the complexity is $O(n^d)$ - The work is dominated by the root node of the recursion tree, which is n^d\n",
    "3. if $a > b^d$, then the complexity is $O(n^{log_ba})$ - The work is dominated by the leaf nodes of the recursion tree, we have $a^{log_bn}$ leaf nodes which is equivelant to $n^{log_ba}$ (take log of each side to prove it).\n",

    "## Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Composed of nodes connected by edges (could be directed or undirected).\n",
    "- $n$: number of nodes, $m$: number of edges.\n",
    "- For all the nodes of the graph to be connected, the number of edges is between $n-1$ and $n(n-1)/2$, so the number of edges is between $O(n)$ and $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "- A graph is sparse if its number of edges is close to $O(n)$ and is dense if its number of edges is close to $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "- Graphs could be represented using and *Adjacency Matrix* (consumes $O(n^2)$ space, more effective for lookup operations) or an *Adjacency List* (consumes $O(n + m)$ space, more effective for search operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breadth First Search**:\n",
    "- Explores from a start node on the graph by peeling off layers one by one.\n",
    "- Uses a FIFO queue.\n",
    "- Runtime is $O(n + m)$\n",
    "- Will find the shortest path (assuming all edges have equal weights).\n",
    "- Will determine the connectedness (islands) in the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depth First Search**:\n",
    "- Explores the graph in a more aggressive approach\n",
    "- Uses LIFO queue (or a stack), or could be solved in a recursive fashion\n",
    "- Runtime is $O(n + m)$\n",
    "- Will not necessarily find the shortest path\n",
    "- Can determine the connectedness of the graph\n",
    "- Can be used to compute the *topological sort* of a graph.\n",
