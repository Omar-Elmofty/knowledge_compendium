    "The bound on the number of edges of a fully connected graph\n",
    "- lower_bound: $n-1$ or $O(n)$, imagine arranging all the nodes in a row, and connecting them all, this will create $n-1$ edges, any number less than that will cause at least one node to be not connected to the rest of the graph.\n",
    "- upper_boubd: n choose 2 $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ or $O(n^2)$, each unique pair of nodes are connected by an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we refer to **sparse** graphs as graphs that have the number of edges closer to the lower bound, and **dense** graphs as  graphs where the number of edges are closer to the upper bound,\n",

    "**Adjacency list**:\n",
    "Space requirement is $\\theta(n + m)$, which makes it more efficient for sparser graphs, it also makes it more efficient for the graph search problem.\n",

    "explore the graph in layers.\n",
    "If all the edges have equal cost, then BFS will arive to the shortest path\n",
    "Runtime is O(n + m). Think about the FIFO queue that we use, it is simply n dimensional, with an additional m work for each edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of breadth first search: shortest path (if edges have equal weights), inspecting the connectedness of graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof as to why breadth first search finds the shortest path: BFS searches the graph by layers, peeling off each layer at a time. Assuming all edges have the same cost, then the shortest path will simply be the number of layers till we reach the goal, and since we peel the graph layer by layer from the start, then we will always find the shortest path (layer) to the goal.\n",

    "## Depth first Search\n",
    "\n",
    "If BFS is the cautious version of the search, DFS is it's more aggressive cousin.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS can be used to find the topological ordering (or topolgical sort) of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be used to compute the strongly connected components of a graph (due to the topological sort ability of this algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dijkstra's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS assumes that all edges have a weight of 1, it will then give you the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could for example break up the graph into unit edges, such that each unit edge, then BFS. Doesn't work, edges can be too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can't do negative edges, can't reduce by adding a large number to all edges. Cost must be strictly increasing.\n",
